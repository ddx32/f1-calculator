### 2025-04-25

- Refactored large parts of the codebase to adapt to some quirks of the new [jolpica-f1 API](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1), which is a spiritual successor to the now defunct ergast API, followed up by a proper caching setup via Cloudflare workers.
- Removed the ability to assign the fastest lap of the race, as no extra points are awarded for it starting with the 2025 season.
- Added a changelog section to the app.
